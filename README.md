# bye-bye-fresh

## Description
Bye Bye Fresh is a website we created where people that have loved Hello Fresh in the past are able to access recipes and see nutritional value. Not only can you access previous recipes but if you do not see a website you have previous loved you can also add it to our database. By creating a login for out site you will be able to save recipes to your account. The whole purpose of this site is for users to be able to choose recipes they would like to cook which will then give a drop down of ingredients in each recipe chosen. From there you can choose the ingredients you do not have in your pantry and we will supply the caloric breakdown of those items. 

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
See screenshots below

## Installation
If you are looking to pull the project and utilize it accordingly. Simply clone the repo and open with an IDE.

If you are looking to deploy the base root directory should work. From there you can utilize the website from your browser.



## Usage
To use this project, you will either want it deployed on a website or running in a live server.

## Support
For support, we do not have a designated team for this since this is a project

## Roadmap
In the future it would be nice to implement the InstaCart API which would allow users to have the ingredients to their cart which would then be delivered and fulfulled by InstaCart.
